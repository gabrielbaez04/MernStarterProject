# MernStarterProject
## MERN skeleton, using Node, Express, and MongoDB:

- User CRUD and auth in a MERN application

- Handling HTTP requests with an Express server

- Using a Mongoose schema for a user model

- APIs for user CRUD and auth

- Auth with JWT for protected routes

- Running backend code and checking APIs

  
This template is a Base application for developing different MERN applications.
We will add the following use cases with user CRUD and auth functionality implementations:

- Sign up: Users can register by creating a new account using an email address

- User list: Any visitor can see the list of all registered users

- Authentication: Registered users can sign in and sign out

- Protected user profile: Only registered users can view individual user details after signing in

- Authorized user edit and delete: Only a registered and authenticated user can edit or remove their own user account details

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.

Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.
After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

> npm install

We use npm scripts and [Webpack][] as our build system. Run the following commands to run the app.
